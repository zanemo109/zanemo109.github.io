            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project aims to give more familiarity with camera settings and positioning through hands-on photography experiments. By taking carefully planned photographs, I gained a better understanding of how camera settings and positioning affect the perception of our subjects.</p>

            <h2>Part 1: Selfie - The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
            <p>In this experiment, I explored how distance and zoom affect portrait photography. The goal was to demonstrate why stepping back and zooming in produces better portraits than taking close-up shots.</p>

            <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
            <p>This experiment demonstrates how focal length affects the perception of depth and spatial relationships. By comparing a zoomed-in distant shot with a wide-angle close shot, we observe the compression effect.</p>

            <h2>Part 3: The Dolly Zoom Effect</h2>
            <p>The dolly zoom creates a disorienting effect by simultaneously moving the camera backward while zooming in on the subject. This keeps the subject the same size while changing the background perspective.</p>

                    <strong>The Dolly Zoom Effect:</strong> An animated sequence of my teddy bear showing the perspective shift as the camera moves back while zooming in. Notice how the subject stays the same size while the background appears to "stretch" away.

            <div class="tech-details">
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>To achieve this effect, I took multiple still photographs while gradually moving the camera backward and increasing the zoom. Each frame was carefully composed to keep the main subject approximately the same size. The resulting images were then combined into an animated GIF to show the continuous transformation.</p>
